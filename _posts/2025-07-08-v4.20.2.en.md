## Update handling of the '@' character in signatures names
Microsoft no longer allows '@' in roaming signature names as it is reserved for internal use, and Microsoft Outlook will follow soon.

This hotfix addresses this change as follws:
- Add '@' to the list of invalid characters for signatures names as documented in sample INI files. The new complete list of invalid characters is '\/:"*?><,|@'.
- Convert all invalid characters to '_', but '@' to '_at_'.
- Only keep the '@' character where it is required for Microsoft internal use in roaming signature names.

For a comprehensive list of all changes, dependencies, and fixes, please consult the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md).
