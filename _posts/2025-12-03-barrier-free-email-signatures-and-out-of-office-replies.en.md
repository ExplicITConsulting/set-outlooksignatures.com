More organizations are recognizing the importance of making their communication inclusive and barrier-free.

That’s why every sample template in Set-OutlookSignatures is designed with accessibility in mind:
- Screen reader–friendly: Every link and image includes descriptive alt text, ensuring clarity for users relying on assistive technologies.
- Inclusive by default: These features aren’t just helpful for users with impairments, they improve clarity and usability for everyone.
- No extra effort required: Accessibility is built in from the start, so your team doesn’t have to think twice.

A simple step toward a more inclusive digital world.
