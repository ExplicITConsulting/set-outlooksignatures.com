More organizations are recognizing the importance of making their communication inclusive and barrier-free.

Around 2.4% of adults worldwide use screen readers due to visual impairment.

Accessibility benefits approximately 1.3 billion people with disabilities, plus their families and caregivers.

But accessability is an ubiquitous demand that is not bound to a permanent disablity. In fact, we all are in situations quite often in which barrier-free emails are easier to read:
- A few moments without glasses or contact lenses.
- Twilight or bright light.
- Low battery mode: When your device switches to simplified display or dark mode.
- Small screens: Reading emails on a smartwatch or older smartphone.
- Multitasking environments: Quickly scanning an email while in a meeting or on public transport.
- Temporary injuries.
- Language barriers: Clear structure and alt text help non-native speakers understand content.
- Stressful or rushed situations: When cognitive load is high and clarity is essential.

Clear, accessible emails help all users: improved readability, quicker engagement, better compliance.

But the reality is different: In 2024, out of 4.26 billion email users worldwide, 99.97% of emails tested contained issues impacting accessibility.

That’s why every sample template in Set-OutlookSignatures is designed with accessibility in mind.

And you can easily make your own signatures barrier-free, without having to sacrifice your design:
- Screen reader–friendly: Every link and image includes descriptive alt text, ensuring clarity for users relying on assistive technologies.
- Inclusive by default: These features aren’t just helpful for users with impairments, they improve clarity and usability for everyone.
- No extra effort required: Accessibility is built in from the start, so your team doesn’t have to think twice.

A simple step toward a more inclusive digital world!
