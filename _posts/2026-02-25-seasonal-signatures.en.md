With Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on, you can schedule, rotate, and automate signature templates based on seasons, campaigns, or defined time periods. Create a template, assign it to selected or all mailboxes, set the active dates - done.

Here are a few ways to make your signatures more impactful:
- Holidays and seasonal themes
- Company milestones and anniversaries
- Trade shows and industry events
- Limited-time offers and promotions
- New product or service launches
- Community and awareness campaigns

When your signatures adapt to your calendar, every email becomes a timely touchpoint that supports marketing, sales, and brand consistency.

Because the right signature at the right moment doesn't just look good - it drives attention, reinforces your message, and keeps your brand relevant in every conversation, every day.

Spring is just around the corner in the northern hemisphere, while autumn is approaching in the global south. There's no better time to make your signatures more dynamic. Let's go!
