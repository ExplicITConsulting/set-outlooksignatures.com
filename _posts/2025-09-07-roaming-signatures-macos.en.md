## We've got you covered
Do you have users accessing Exchange Online mailboxes with Outlook for Mac? Then you'll want to hear this.

With Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on, you can centrally manage and deploy email signatures and out-of-office replies, also for Outlook for Mac.

Here's the catch: Classic and New Outlook for Mac only support locally stored signatures. That means no roaming, no consistency, and no control.

Enter the Benefactor Circle add-on:
- Enable roaming signatures stored in the mailbox
- Ensure consistency across devices and platforms
- Unlock even more advanced features for centralized signature management

Because email signatures aren't just a sign-off, they're part of your brand, your compliance strategy, and your communication culture.
