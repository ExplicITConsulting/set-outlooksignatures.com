## Many assume that managing email signatures only makes sense for large enterprises
But the numbers tell a different story.

Let's break it down:
- Average employee cost: €0.55 per minute (based on €60,000 per year for 1,800 hours)
- 1 device, 2 signatures
- 2 updates per year
- 3 minutes per update

That's €6.60 per user per year spent on manual signature updates alone.

Now compare that to Set-OutlookSignatures:
- €3.00 per mailbox per year
- Fully automated
- Always compliant with CI/CD and legal standards

And the benefits go beyond cost savings:
- Time saved on shared mailboxes and out-of-office replies
- Consistent branding and professional appearance
- Reduced risk of regulatory non-compliance
- A new, trackable marketing channel in every email

Set-OutlookSignatures pays for itself and helps you unlock new value from every message.
