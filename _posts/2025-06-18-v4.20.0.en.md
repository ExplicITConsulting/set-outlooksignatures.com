## Cross-tenant access and Multitenant Organizations
The need for cross-tenant mailbox access—whether for a merger, acquisition, or complex organization—breaks most traditional signature solutions. Why? Because their architecture simply can't handle it. Set-OutlookSignatures solves this. Rleease v4.20.0 introduces full cross-tenant support that works seamlessly.

## Encoding detection
Ever since IT came into existence, encoding has been a necessary but annoying topic. Modern systems can handle around 140 different encodings. Unicode is not a universal solution, as at least six different variants are used.

Set-OutlookSignatures now comes bundled with UTF.Unknown for encoding detection. A ready-to-reuse function not only makes encoding detection a breeze, but also encoding conversion, and even takes into consideration HTML specifics.

## New Features
- Support for cross-tenant access and Multitenant Organizations.
- Automatic HTML encoding detection and UTF-8 conversion.
- Customizable notification text in the Outlook add-in.

## Improvements
- Reduced Entra ID throttling with optimized token refresh logic.
- Completely rewritten Quick Start Guide.
- Verbose output now shows all replacement variables.

## Fixes
- DOCX templates no longer open in Read view.
- Correct handling of HTML templates with multiple image references.
- Support for Outlook profile names with special characters.

## Updated dependencies
- MSAL.Net 4.73.0, PreMailer.Net 2.7.0, HtmlAgilityPack 1.12.1, QRCoder 1.6.0.
