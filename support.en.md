<blockquote>
  <p>
    Since it's first release as a 
    <a href="/faq#44-what-can-i-learn-from-the-code-of-set-outlooksignatures">technology demonstrator</a>, Set-OutlookSignatures has evolved into the most advanced, secure and versatile free and open-source tool for managing email signatures and out-of-office replies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sustaining long-term development for such a project requires significant financial resources. Currently, we do not have enough open-source sponsors to cover these costs fully.
  </p>
  <p>
    To bridge this gap, ExplicIT Consulting offers the 
    <a href="/benefactorcircle">Benefactor Circle add-on</a> and first-class <a href="#professional-support">professional support</a>. Revenue from these options ensures continued development and quality for both open-source and paid versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    By choosing Set-OutlookSignatures, your company reduces costs compared to commercial alternatives while benefiting from a powerful open-source solution. Upgrading to the Benefactor Circle add-on and professional support helps secure its future.
