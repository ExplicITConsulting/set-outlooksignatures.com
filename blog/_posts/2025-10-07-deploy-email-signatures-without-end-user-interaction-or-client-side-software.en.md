## In some environments, running client-based tools just isn’t an option
This is often the case with Microsoft 365 F licenses or Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) setups.

That’s where Set-OutlookSignatures steps in—with a powerful built-in feature: SimulateAndDeploy

With SimulateAndDeploy, you can roll out email signatures and out-of-office replies:
- Without any user interaction
- Without installing or running anything on the client
- With full support for Microsoft roaming signatures
- Including additional and automapped mailboxes from Exchange Online

It’s the world’s first and only solution that makes this level of deployment possible.
