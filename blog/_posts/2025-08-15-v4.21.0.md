## New features for the Outlook add-in
New launch events and custom code support:
- React to launch events OnMessageRecipientsChanged and OnAppointmentAttendeesChanged.
- Allow adding custom code to the add-in so you can directly influence which signature it will set.  
  For example, you can set a specific signature…
    - …when there are only internal recipients, or another signature when there are external recipients
    - …depending on the from email address
    - …when a specific customer is in the To field
    - …when the current item is a mail or an appointment
    - …when the current item is a new mail, or another signature when it is a reply or a forward
    - …depending on the subject
    - …or any other condition derived from the information available in the customRulesProperties object  

See '`.\sample code\CustomRulesCode.js`' in the Outlook add-in folder for details.
