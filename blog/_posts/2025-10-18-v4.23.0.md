### Goodbye formatting headaches with addresses and phone numbers, hello global standards
Set-OutlookSignatures v4.23.0 is here, delivering a major upgrade focused on two common — and surprisingly complex — pain points in global IT: Perfectly formatting phone numbers and postal addresses.

This release integrates world-class open-source libraries to ensure your organization's contact information is globally correct and consistently professional in every signature.

### Perfect phone numbers, effortlessly
We think phone numbers are easy because we assume they are just numbers and forget about global complexity. If you still think so, reading the article '[Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Phone Numbers](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/faq/#4412-format-phone-numbers)' will change your mind.

We've added a new phone number formatter based on Google's libphonenumber library.

This feature converts raw numbers (and an optional country code) into standardized formats:
- Human-readable INTERNATIONAL or NATIONAL formats.
- Technical RFC3966 format for reliable `tel:` links.
- A custom formatting option.

New replacement variables, such as '`$CurrentUserTelephone-International$`' and '`$CurrentMailboxManagerMobile-RFC3966$`', are now available.

For implementation details, see our [Format Phone Numbers FAQ](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/faq/#4412-format-phone-numbers).

### Accurate postal addresses for any country
Just like phone numbers, postal addresses seem like child's play - if you're only working nationally. However, "Different countries, different customs". Read the article '[Falsehoods programmers believe about addresses](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/faq/#4413-format-postal-addresses)' to understand the global chaos we've tamed.

A new Address Formatter module, based on OpenCage GmbH's work, ensures addresses are assembled according to country-specific rules.

Input named address components (over 20 available) and the country code to output the correctly formatted string via the new '`$Current[User|UserManager|Mailbox|MailboxManager]PostalAddress$`' variables. A necessity for multinational companies.

For implementation details, see our [Format Postal Addresses FAQ](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/faq/#4413-format-postal-addresses).

### Other key changes
* QR Code Update: The sample QR code format has changed from MeCard to the more common vCard format.
* Security: Added a check for PowerShell Full Language Mode to all administrative scripts.
* Fix: Corrected an issue with culture-aware sorting in the Intune remediation sample script.
