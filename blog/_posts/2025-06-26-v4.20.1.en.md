## Corrections for cleaning up signatures
This hotfix resolves issues with the parameters '`DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate`' and '`DeleteUserCreatedSignatures`'.

While '`DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate`' did not delete obsolete signatures, the same error in the code caused '`DeleteUserCreatedSignatures`' (disabled by default) to delete even non-user signatures.

A comprehensive list of all changes, dependencies, and bug fixes can be found in the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md).
