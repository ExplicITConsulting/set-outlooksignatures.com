## Addressing changes in Microsofts roaming signatures API
- Add workaround for Microsoft internal problems with roaming signatures API, which would result in the following error when uploading roaming signatures to mailboxes which are not the one of the logged-on user (especially in SimulateAndDeploy mode). The log would contain the error 'The response status code for https://localhost:444/owa/service.svc?action=SanitizeHtml action \u0027SanitizeHtml\u0027 is InternalServerError. ReasonPhrase:Internal Server Error'.
- Add hints about probable root causes of empty signatures lists in the log output of the Outlook add-in.

For a comprehensive list of all changes, dependencies, and fixes, please consult the official [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/blob/main/docs/CHANGELOG.md).
