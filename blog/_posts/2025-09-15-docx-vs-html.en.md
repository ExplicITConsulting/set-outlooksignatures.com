## The signature template choice that actually matters
Most solutions lock you into a proprietary HTML editor. But at Set-OutlookSignatures, we believe in giving you the freedom to choose.

That’s why we support both HTML and DOCX templates, because flexibility should never be a compromise.

So why do most of our clients choose DOCX?
- Familiarity wins: Most people managing signatures and out-of-office replies know Microsoft Word. HTML? Not so much, and that number is shrinking.
- Consistency across clients: Our rendering engine ensures your signature looks great across Outlook, mobile, and even non-Microsoft email clients.
- Smarter image handling: Add account pictures and effects with ease. We generate final images with filters applied, no fragile CSS tricks required.

Let’s be honest: Word isn’t a perfect HTML editor. But with Set-OutlookSignatures, it becomes a powerful, user-friendly design tool, backed by logic that keeps your emails looking sharp everywhere.
