    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>Email signatures and out-of-office replies are an integral part of corporate identity and corporate design, of successful concepts for media and internet presence, and of marketing campaigns. Similar to web presences, business emails are usually subject to an imprint obligation, and non-compliance can result in severe penalties.</p>
  </div>
</div>

Central management and deployment ensures that design guidelines are met, guarantees correct and up-to-date content, helps comply with legal requirements, relieves staff and creates an additional marketing and sales channel for free.

**Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on can do all this, and much more.**

**Full-featured, cost-effective, unsurpassed data privacy:**

With Set-OutlookSignatures, signatures and out-of-office replies can be:
- Generated from **templates in DOCX or HTML** file format  
- Customized with a **broad range of variables**, including **photos**, from Active Directory and other sources
  - Variables are available for the **currently logged-on user, this user's manager, each mailbox and each mailbox's manager**
  - Images in signatures can be **bound to the existence of certain variables** (useful for optional social network icons, for example)
- Designed for **barrier-free accessibility** with custom link and image descriptions for screen readers and comparable tools
- Applied to all **mailboxes (including shared mailboxes¹)**, specific **mailbox groups**, specific **email addresses** (including alias and secondary addresses), or specific **user or mailbox properties**, for **every mailbox across all Outlook profiles (Outlook, New Outlook¹, Outlook Web¹)**, including **automapped and additional mailboxes¹**  
- Created with different names from the same template, **one template can be used for many mailboxes**
- Assigned **time ranges** within which they are valid¹  
- Set as **default signature** for new emails, or for replies and forwards (signatures only)  
- Set as **default OOF message** for internal or external recipients (OOF messages only)  
- Set in **Outlook Web¹** for the currently logged-in user, including mirroring signatures to the cloud as **roaming signatures¹** (Linux/macOS/Windows, Classic and New Outlook¹)  
- Centrally managed only¹, or **exist along user-created signatures** (signatures only)  
- Automatically added to new emails, reply emails and appointments with the **Outlook add-in**¹  
- Copied to an **additional path¹** for easy access to signatures on mobile devices or for use with email clients and apps besides Outlook: Apple Mail, Google Gmail, Samsung Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, GNOME Evolution, KDE KMail, and others.
- Create an **email draft containing all available signatures** in HTML and plain text for easy access in mail clients that do not have a signatures API
- **Write protected** (Outlook for Windows signatures only)

Set-OutlookSignatures can be **run by users on Windows, Linux and macOS clients, including shared devices and terminal servers - or on a central system with a service account¹**.  
On clients, it can run as part of the logon script, as scheduled task, or on user demand via a desktop icon, start menu entry, shortcut or any other way of starting a program - **whatever your operating system and software deployment mechanism allows**.  
Signatures and OOF messages can also be created and pushed into mailboxes centrally, **without end user or client involvement¹**.

**Sample templates** for signatures and OOF messages demonstrate many features and are provided as .docx and .htm files.

**Simulation mode** allows content creators and admins to simulate the behavior of the software for a specific user at a specific point in time, and to inspect the resulting signature files before going live.

**SimulateAndDeploy¹** allows to deploy signatures to Outlook Web¹/New Outlook¹ (when based on Outlook Web) without any client deployment or end user interaction, making it ideal for users that only log on to web services but never to a client (users with a Microsoft 365 F-license, for example).

The software is **designed to work in big and complex environments** (Exchange resource forest scenarios, across AD trusts, multi-level AD subdomains, many objects). It works **on premises, in hybrid and in cloud-only environments**.  
All **national clouds are supported**: Public (AzurePublic), US Government L4 (AzureUSGovernment), US Government L5 (AzureUSGovernment DoD), China (AzureChinaCloud operated by 21Vianet).

It is **multi-client capable** by using different template paths, configuration files and script parameters.

Set-OutlookSignatures requires **no installation on servers or clients**. You only need a standard SMB file share on a central system, and optionally Office on your clients.  
There is also **no telemetry** or "calling home", emails are **not routed through a 3rd party data center or cloud service**, and there is **no need to change DNS records (MX, SPF) or email flow**.

A **documented implementation approach**, based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes, contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators.  
The implementation approach is **suited for service providers as well as for clients**, and covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.

The software core is **Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)**. It is published under a license which is approved, among others, by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open Source Initiative (OSI), and is compatible with the General Public License (GPL) and other popular licenses. Please see `.\LICENSE.txt` for copyright and license details.

Footnote 1 (¹): **Some features are exclusive to the Benefactor Circle add-on.**
ExplicIT Consulting's commercial Benefactor Circle add-on enhances Set-OutlookSignatures with additional features and fee-based support, ensuring that the core of Set-OutlookSignatures can remain Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) and continues to evolve. See <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> for details.


## Demo video
<a href="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/K9TrCjTdRUI" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/K9TrCjTdRUI/hqdefault.jpg" height="300" title="Set-OutlookSignatures demo video" alt="Set-OutlookSignatures demo video"></a>


## Quick Start Guide
Deploy your first signatures in less than an hour!

1. For a first test run, it is recommended to log on with a test user on a Windows system with Word and Outlook installed, and Outlook being configured with at least the test user's mailbox. This way, you get results fast and can experience the biggest set of features.
   - For full Linux and macOS support, the Benefactor Circle add-on (see <a href="./Benefactor%20Circle.md" target="_blank">'.\docs\Benefactor Circle'</a> and is required and the mailboxes need to be hosted in Exchange Online.
2. Download Set-OutlookSignatures and extract the archive to a local folder
   - On Windows and macOS, unblock the file 'Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1'. You can use the PowerShell cmdlet 'Unblock-File' for this, or right-click the file in File Explorer, select Properties and check 'Unblock'. This removes the "mark of the web", which can prevent script execution when the PowerShell execution policy is set to RemoteSigned.
3. If you use AppLocker or a comparable solution (Defender, CrowdStrike, Ivanti, and others), you may need to add the existing digital file signature to your allow list, or define additional settings in your security software.
4. Now it is time to run Set-OutlookSignatures for the first time
   - **If _all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _on-prem only_ and the logged-in user has access to the on-prem Active Directory:**<br>Just run 'Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1' in PowerShell.<br>For best results, don't run the software by double clicking it in File Explorer, or via right-click and 'Run'. Instead, run the following command:
   
      ```batch
      powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1"
      ```

   - **If _some or all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _Online_:**
     1. You need to register an Entra ID app first, because Set-OutlookSignatures needs permissions to access the Graph API.
          - To create the Entra ID app, run '`.\sample code\Create-EntraApp.ps1 -AppType 'Set-OutlookSignatures' -AppName 'Set-OutlookSignatures'`' and follow the instructions. You will need an Entra ID user with 'Global Admin' or 'Application Administrator' permissions.
          - See '`.\config\default graph config.ps1`' for details about the required application settings, permissions, and why they are needed.
     2. Run Set-OutlookSignatures
        - **If _all mailboxes_ are in Exchange _Online_, or you are in a hybrid environment _without_ synchronizing all required Exchange attributes to on-prem** (mail, legacyExchangeDN, msExchRecipientTypeDetails, msExchMailboxGuid, proxyAddresses):

          ```batch
          powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1" -GraphOnly true -GraphClientId "<GraphClientId from step 1>"
          ```

          Always choose this option if you are in **hybrid mode and directly create new mailboxes in Exchange Online**, as at least the required attribute msExchMailboxGuid is not synchronized to on-prem in this case. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/exchange/troubleshoot/move-mailboxes/migrationpermanentexception-when-moving-mailboxes for details and two possible workarounds.

          The '`-GraphOnly true`' parameter makes sure that on-prem Active Directory is ignored and only Graph/Entra ID is used to find mailboxes and their attributes.
        - **If _all mailboxes_ are in a hybrid environment _with_ synchronizing all required Exchange attributes to on-prem** (mail, legacyExchangeDN, msExchRecipientTypeDetails, msExchMailboxGuid, proxyAddresses):

          ```batch
          powershell.exe -noexit -file "c:\test\Set-OutlookSignatures.ps1" -GraphClientId "<GraphClientID from step 1>"
          ```

          This runs Set-OutlookSignatures with default parameters, preferring on-prem Active Directory to find mailboxes and their attributes, and only using Graph/Entra ID when neccessary.
        - If you are not using the public Microsoft Cloud, add the parameter '`-CloudEnvironment [AzureUSGovernment|AzureUSGovernmentDoD|AzureChina]`' parameter.
<p></p>
Set-OutlookSignatures now runs using default settings and sample templates.<br>Because of the '`-noexit`' parameter, the window hosting Set-OutlookSignatures will not close after the software completed. This is helpful for debugging and learning.<br><br>

Next, check the script output for errors, displayed in red in the PowerShell console.
- If there are no errors, switch to Outlook and have a look at the newly created signatures, especially to the showcase signature named '`Test all default replacement variables`'.
- If there is an error:
  1. Read the message carefully as it may contain hints on how to resolve the issue.  
  2. Check if the README file contains a hint.
  3. Check if someone has already reported the problem as and issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Set-OutlookSignatures/Set-OutlookSignatures/issues?q=is%3Aissue), and create a new one if you can't find any hint on how to solve it. You can also switch to the fast lane: [ExplicIT Consulting](https://explicitconsulting.at) offers first-class fee-based support.

When everything runs fine with default settings, it is time to start customizing the software behavior to your needs:
- Create a folder with your own template files and signature configuration file.
  - Start with DOCX templates. See '`Should I use .docx or .htm as file format for templates?`' in this document for details.
  - See the following chapters in this document for instructions:
    - Signature and OOF file format
    - Signature template file naming
    - Template tags and INI files
  - Make sure to pass the parameters '`SignatureTemplatePath`', '`SignatureIniFile`', '`OOFTemplatePath`' and '`OOFIniFile`' to Set-OutlookSignatures.
- Adapt other parameters you may find useful, or start experimenting with simulation mode.<br>The feature list and the parameter documentation show what's possible.<br><br>

It is strongly recommended to not change any Set-OutlookSignatures files and keep them as they are. If you consequently work with script parameters and keep customized configuration files in a separate folder, upgrading to a new version is basically just a file copy operation (drop-in replacement).

Regarding configuration files: Besides the template configuration files for signatures and OOF messages, there are the Graph configuration file and the replacement variable configuration file.  
It is rarely needed to change the configuration within these files.<br>The configuration files themselves contain specific information on how to use them.<br>The configuration files are referenced in the documentation whenever there is a need or option to change them.

You also have access to '`.\docs\Implementation approach`', a document covering the organizational aspects of introducing Set-OutlookSignatures.
The content is based on real life experiences implementing the software in multi-client environments with a five-digit number of mailboxes.  
It contains proven procedures and recommendations for product managers, architects, operations managers, account managers and email and client administrators. It is suited for service providers as well as for clients.  
It covers several general overview topics, administration, support, training across the whole lifecycle from counselling to tests, pilot operation and rollout up to daily business.
