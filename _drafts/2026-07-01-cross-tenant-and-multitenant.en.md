In today's hybrid work environment and complex organizational structures, signature management isn't just a single-tenant challenge.

Until now, cross-tenant deployments often meant clunky workarounds, frustrating limitations, or endless manual effort.

Set-OutlookSignatures ended that era already:
- Full support for cross-tenant access and Microsoft 365 Multitenant Organizations
- Deploy signatures to mailboxes outside the user’s home tenant effortlessly
- Access to all properties, replacement variables, and our exclusive Benefactor Circle features

Cross-tenant and multitenant is easy to implement - just follow the instructions of the '[GraphClientID](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/parameters#4-graphclientid)' parameter.
