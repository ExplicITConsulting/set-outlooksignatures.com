_**Benefactor Circle add-on users with mailboxes in Exchange Online should update to this version as soon as possible.**_ Microsoft will begin changing roaming signature HTML processing shortly. Update as soon as possible to avoid potential negative impact on the parameters '`DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate`' and '`DeleteUserCreatedSignatures`'.


## Streamlined signature design with shorter variables
Designing signatures with limited space just got easier. We have introduced shorter replacement variable names that can be used interchangeably with the original long names. This applies to both default and custom variables.

* **CurrentUser** can now be shortened to **U** (e.g., `$UVariableX$`)
* **CurrentUserManager** can now be shortened to **UM** (e.g., `$UMVariableX$`)
* **CurrentMailbox** can now be shortened to **M** (e.g., `$MVariableX$`)
* **CurrentMailboxManager** can now be shortened to **MM** (e.g., `$MMVariableX$`)


## Enhanced diagnostic warnings and resilience
Set-OutlookSignatures now provides improved proactive warnings to identify potential misconfigurations or environment constraints:
- **GPO Overrides:** The script will warn you if a Group Policy Object setting takes precedence over registry values set by the script, such as '`DisableRoamingSignatures`'.
- **Graph API Resilience:** We have made Graph API queries more robust by implementing automatic retries after five seconds to compensate for brief network or data center "hiccups".
- **Template Auditing:** Receive warnings for non-standard image formats (outside of JPG, PNG, and GIF) or signatures exceeding 30,000 characters, which may fail in Outlook add-in launch events.


## Updates for Benefactor Circle add-on users
The Benefactor Circle add-on and Outlook add-in receive several key enhancements for advanced deployments:
- **Automatic Image Embedding:** Images are now embedded when setting Outlook Web signatures (classic and roaming) regardless of global parameters, ensuring high-quality display even for default signatures.
- **Improved Cleanup Logic:** The '`DeleteScriptCreatedSignaturesWithoutTemplate`' parameter is now more aggressive in removing "leftover" signatures when toggling roaming signature settings.
- **Admin Tooling:** The Entra app creation script has been updated to force the use of the PowerShell Gallery and ensure all required package providers are present.
