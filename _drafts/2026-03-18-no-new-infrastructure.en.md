Many solutions require new servers, connectors, or email rerouting.

Set-OutlookSignatures doesn’t.
- Runs on your existing systems
- No new dependencies
- No external data transfers

Simple, secure, and scalable - without the overhead.

This is made possible by architecture developed from practical experience for practical use, with a focus on work simplification and data protection rather than profit.

With the [Quick Start Guide](/quickstart), you can deploy signatures within minutes, in just three easy steps.
