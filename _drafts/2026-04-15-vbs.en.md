Still using VBS scripts to deploy email signatures? Level up now!

VBS has already been [marked as deprecated](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/vbscript-deprecation-timelines-and-next-steps/4148301) by Microsoft, and it’s only a matter of time before it disappears from future Windows releases.
