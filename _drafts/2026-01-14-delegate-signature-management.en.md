Who manages your email signatures and out-of-office replies? In many organizations, it's still the IT department. But in most cases, this task belongs with marketing or communications.

With Set-OutlookSignatures, delegation is simple and flexible. Templates are stored in regular folders on your file system, so all you need are standard file and folder permissions.

Here's how it works:
- IT defines when and where Set-OutlookSignatures runs, and where templates and config files are stored
- Users with full access to the template folder can create and edit templates
- Users with modify rights can update existing templates, or just specific files
- Users with write access to the config file can assign templates to mailboxes, users, or groups

You can configure all of this separately for signatures and out-of-office replies. You can even run multiple instances of Set-OutlookSignatures with separate configurations in the same environment.

And the best part?
Set-OutlookSignatures only needs a file share or SharePoint document library. No admin client, no server dependencies, no email rerouting.
