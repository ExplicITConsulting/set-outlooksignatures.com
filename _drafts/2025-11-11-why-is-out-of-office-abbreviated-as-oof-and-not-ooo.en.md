It's one of those quirks that makes you pause: Why do we say OOF instead of OOO?

Let's rewind to the 1980s. Back then, Microsoft Xenix was the leading Unix OS - yes, really! - and Microsoft was running its mail system on it. This system had a feature to notify others when someone was unavailable, marked as Out Of Facility (OOF).

Over time, "Out Of Facility" evolved into "Out Of Office", but the abbreviation OOF stuck.

Why? Probably because it's easier to pronounce than "OOO".

## Bonus trivia: Ever heard someone say "Little 'r' me"?
That's a nod to Outlook keyboard shortcuts:
- Ctrl+R (little r) = Reply
- Ctrl+Shift+R (big R) = Reply All
