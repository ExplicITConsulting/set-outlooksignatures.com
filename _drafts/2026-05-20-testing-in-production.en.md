Rolling out updates to signature or OOF templates in a live environment can be nerve-wracking. Common concerns include:
- Did I cover all scenarios?
- What if I accidentally overwrite a VIP’s OOF message?
- Will this impact a whole department?

Test environments rarely offer peace of mind. Even when available, two big issues remain:
- Does the test environment truly mirror production?
- How can I impersonate another user without jumping through hoops?

Set-OutlookSignatures comes with [Simulation Mode](https://set-outlooksignatures.com/details#11-simulation-mode), designed to eliminate the guesswork:
- Test safely within your production environment
- Simulate any user, with any mailbox configuration
- No need to involve the user or request extra permissions

The confidence you need, without the risk.
