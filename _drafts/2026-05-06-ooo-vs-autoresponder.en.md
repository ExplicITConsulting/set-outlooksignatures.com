At first glance, the choice seems obvious. But a closer look reveals key differences that might change your perspective.

Out-of-office replies are ideal when an employee is unavailable due to illness, vacation, part-time work, or business travel.
- Sends one reply per sender—no inbox flooding
- Doesn’t store replies in Sent Items
- Can be managed by delegated roles like supervisors or helpdesks
- No image support (yet), due to Exchange limitations

Autoresponder rules, on the other hand, are often better for shared mailboxes.
- Sends a reply to every message received
- Replies are stored in Sent Items
- Easily editable by anyone with full mailbox access
- Supports images and seasonal customizations

With Set-OutlookSignatures, you can deploy standardized out-of-office replies - internal and external - with the same flexibility as email signatures. In most cases, users only need to enter their return date before activating the assistant.
