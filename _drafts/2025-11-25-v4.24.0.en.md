## Intuitive account picture integration in DOCX templates
Adding user photos to your DOCX signature templates is now significantly simpler.

You can now insert an account picture by simply adding a shape to your DOCX template, positioning it "inline with text," and setting the picture replacement variable (e.g., '$CurrentUserPhoto$') in the shape's alternative text. The script automatically populates the shape with the user's photo.

## Enhanced diagnostic warnings for mailbox configuration
Set-OutlookSignatures now provides improved proactive warnings to identify potential misconfigurations in your directory that could lead to signature errors.

The script will warn you if a mailbox lacks the 'mail' attribute, if the 'mail' attribute doesn't match the primary SMTP address, or if multiple primary SMTP addresses are defined.

These checks help ensure reliable operation of signature deployment and other Microsoft applications.

## Critical stability and compatibility updates
Several updates were made to ensure robust performance across various environments:
- MS Graph workarounds: We have implemented a workaround for issues where Microsoft Graph occasionally sends malformed IDs for mailbox elements, which previously caused errors.
- Authentication fixes: An update addresses changes in the Windows 'dsregcmd /status' output, ensuring that Integrated Windows Authentication without login hint remains functional, even when multiple work accounts are added.
- Phone and address formatting: Country detection logic for phone number and postal address formatting now correctly handles null values and whitespace strings, preventing formatting errors.

## Updates for Benefactor Circle add-on users
The Outlook add-in receives key enhancements for advanced deployments:
- Granular launchevent control: A new configuration parameter, 'LAUNCHEVENTS_HOSTS_AND_PLATFORMS', provides significantly finer control over which launch events are enabled on specific hosts and platforms.
- New Outlook/OWA workaround: A critical workaround has been added to address an issue in New Outlook and Outlook Web where the signature was sometimes added repeatedly instead of being replaced when recipients were changed.
