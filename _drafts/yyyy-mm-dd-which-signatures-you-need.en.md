Email signatures are more than just a digital business card; they are a vital tool for brand consistency, professionalism, and legal compliance in digital communication. However, the demands of a modern business go far beyond a simple standard signature.

With a powerful solution like Set-OutlookSignatures, you can easily implement a wide variety of signature scenarios. Here, you will learn which signatures your company needs or could benefit from.

## Standard requirement: The foundation for every mailbox
Every employee requires a professional email signature. This is the indispensable basis for all internal and external communication.

* Personal Mailboxes: The absolute necessity. Every employee receives a personalized signature containing their contact details and company information.

## Widespread scenarios: Common use cases
These use cases quickly become relevant in most professional environments.

### New emails vs. replies/forwards
It is often beneficial to use a shorter, less intrusive signature for replies and forwards to keep the conversation clean and easy to follow.

* New emails: Full signature with all details (contact information, social media, disclaimer).
* Replies/Forwards: A reduced signature, often containing only the name and essential company information.

### Shared Mailboxes
Teams frequently use a joint mailbox (e.g., info@, support@). The challenge: the recipient needs to know who actually sent the email.

* Solution with Set-OutlookSignatures: The software allows mixing the mailbox's replacement variables with those of the sender. The signature will contain the general contact details of the shared mailbox, but the name of the employee who composed the email.

### Delegation scenarios (Delegates)
Whether it's holiday coverage, executive assistant setups, or temporary absences due to illness—emails must be answered professionally.

* Mixing Variables: Set-OutlookSignatures makes it possible to combine the variables of the primary mailbox (e.g., the manager) with the variables of the actual sender (e.g., the assistant) to ensure communication transparency.

### Departmental and team signatures
Different departments often have different requirements for their signatures (e.g., additional legal notices for the legal department or specialized contact information for sales).

* Targeted Signatures: Define signatures for Sales, Support, Marketing, or Executive Management that apply exclusively to those groups.

## Special cases: For advanced requirements
These scenarios will help you elevate your email communication to a higher, more flexible level.

### For distribution lists
Emails sent via a Distribution List often represent a group or a topic, not a single individual. A generic signature without a personal name, but with the list's contact details, is appropriate here.

### For different SMTP addresses (alias addresses)
A single mailbox can have multiple email addresses (aliases). The signature should automatically insert contact details and links appropriate for the alias used (e.g., a project website if the project-x@... alias is used).

### For different recipient groups (internal vs. external)
Not all information is intended for every recipient.

* External Signature: Contains complete mandatory legal disclaimers, full contact details, marketing banners.
* Internal Signature: Often very brief (just name and extension), without disclaimers or marketing banners. Set-OutlookSignatures can automatically control this based on the recipient's domain.

### In different languages
In globally operating companies, the recipient's or sender's language is crucial.

* Language Adaptation: The signature is automatically inserted in the correct language (e.g., German, English, French).

### Time-adjusted (marketing banners)
The signature is an excellent, cost-effective advertising space. Make use of it!

* Seasonal or Time-Limited Banners: Notices for trade fairs/events, product launches, holiday greetings, or company anniversaries.

## Conclusion
Managing this complexity manually is impossible. A centralized solution like Set-OutlookSignatures ensures that every email, regardless of scenario or sender, is consistent, up-to-date, and legally compliant. This turns your signatures into a real asset for your company.
