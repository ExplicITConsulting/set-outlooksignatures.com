Your email signature is more than just a sign-off. It's a subtle but powerful marketing tool. With the right timing, it can help reinforce your brand and message.

With Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on you can schedule and rotate signature templates based on time periods, campaigns, or seasonal events. Just create a template, assign it to selected or all mailboxes, and define when it should be active.

Here are a few ways to make your signatures more impactful:
- Holidays and seasonal themes
- Company milestones and anniversaries
- Trade shows and industry events
- Limited-time offers and promotions
- New product or service launches
- Community and awareness campaigns

Let your signature reflect what matters most to your business, all year round.
