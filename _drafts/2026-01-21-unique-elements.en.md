The first thing that comes to mind is the visual design: Fonts, colors, logos, banners, and icons.

But a signature can also include content-specific features. These might be account pictures, multilingual greetings and job titles, contact details of the supervisor, directions to the office, links to personal social media profiles and self-service appointment booking.

Or something more fancy like dynamically calculated years of service in the company, a personal quote, a QR code, or a greeting automatically derived from the weather forecast?

Last, but not least, there is also the aspect of barrier-free accessibility. This helps not only people with visual impairments but also improves usability for everyone. Think of font sizes, color contrasts, and links or images with textual descriptions for screen readers.

All this - [and more](/features)! - is possible with Set-OutlookSignatures and the Benefactor Circle add-on.
