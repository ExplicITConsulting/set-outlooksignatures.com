Signature management solutions like Set-OutlookSignatures are designed to reduce user errors, simplify updates, and empower IT and marketing teams to manage signatures efficiently.

Sometimes, you want to deploy a signature only once, allow the user to personalize it, and never overwrite it again.

There are three ways to achive this with Set-OutlookSignatures:
1. **Tie a template to a custom replacement variable**  
    Define a signature template in your INI file and use a custom replacement variable to control deployment.

    Your custom code checks if the signature already exists - if it does, it sets the custom variable to false and stops deployment.
2. **Use the VirtualMailboxConfigFile parameter that comes with the Benefactor Circle add-on**  
    This advanced method defines the signature configuration entirely in code, not in the INI file.
    
    Your custom code can include conditional logic based on group membership, user attributes and more.
3. **The clever alternative: Deploy a reference signature users can copy and modify**  
    This is the most popular approach among our customers. Instead of enforcing a one-time deployment, you provide an always up-to-date reference signature. Users can copy it, personalize it, and use it as their own.
    
    It's not technically a one-time deployment, but it's a clever, user-friendly alternative that balances consistency with flexibility.
