## General terms and conditions for the sale and the delivery of organisational and programming services and permissions to use copyrighted software products
1 Scope of contract and validity

1.1. All orders and agreements shall only be legally binding insofar as these are signed in writing with the legally binding signature of the company of the Contractor and shall only obligate to the extent stated in the acceptance of order. Purchase conditions of the Client shall herewith be excluded for the respective legal transaction and the entire business relationship. All offers are generally non-binding.

2 Scope and assessment

2.1. The subject matter of an order may be:
- Preparing organisational concepts
- Global and detail analyses
- Compiling individual programmes
- Delivering library (standard-) programmes
- Purchasing usage rights of software products
- Purchasing permissions to use copyrighted products
- Assisting in start-up (restructuring support)
- Telephone consultations
- Programme maintenance
- Compiling programme media
- Miscellaneous services

2.2. Individual organizational concepts and programmes shall be created depending on the nature and volume of binding information, documents and resources provided in full by the Client. These shall include sufficient practical test data and test facilities provided by the Client in due time, during normal working hours and at their own expense. Should the system be provided by the Client for the test work in regular operation, it shall be incumbent upon the Client to secure the regular data.

2.3. The development of individual programmes shall be based on the written performance description chargeably created by the Contractor by means of the documents and information provided to them and/or that the Client provides. The Client shall review this performance description in terms of accuracy and completeness and mark it with a sign of acceptance. Subsequent change requests may lead to separate schedule and price agreements.

2.4. The Client shall accept the respective programme package of individually developed software and/or programme adaptations four weeks after delivery at the latest. The Client shall verify acceptance on record. (Checks for accuracy and completeness by means of the performance description accepted by the Contractor using the test data mentioned in Clause 2.2.). Should the Client let the four-week period pass without acceptation, the delivered software shall be considered as accepted on the end date of the stipulated period. In any case, the software shall be considered as accepted should it be used in real operation by the Client.
Any defects, that is to say deviations from the performance description agreed upon in writing, shall be reported to the Contractor in written form and with sufficient documentation by the Client; the Contractor shall make efforts to quickly rectify the defects. Should substantial defects, which are reported in writing, occur, i.e. real operation cannot be started or continued, new acceptance shall be necessary after rectification of defects. 
The Client shall not be entitled to refuse acceptance of software due to unsubstantial defects.

2.5. When ordering library (standard) programmes, the Client shall confirm knowledge of the scope of services of the ordered programmes upon ordering.

2.6. Should it become obvious during the course of work that fulfilment of the order, according to the performance description, is actually or legally impossible, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Client thereof. Should the Client not adapt the performance description accordingly and/or not create conditions that make possible fulfilment, the Contractor may refuse fulfilment. Should the inability of fulfilment be caused by default of the Client or by a retrospective change of the performance description by the Client, the Contractor shall be entitled to withdraw from the contract. The Client shall reimburse the Contractor any costs and expenses incurred for the work of the Contractor so far as well as for possible disassembly costs.

2.7. Delivery of programme media, documentation and performance descriptions shall take place at the cost and risk of the Client. Further training and explanations requested by the Client shall be invoiced separately. Insurances shall only be obtained at the request of the Client.

2.8. We expressly indicate that a barrier-free design, as defined by the Federal Law on Equality of Persons with Disabilities (Federal Disability Discrimination Act — BGStG) is not included in the quote, unless this was separately/individually requested by the Client. Should a barrier-free design not have been agreed upon, it shall be incumbent upon the Client to check the admissibility of the service with regard to the Federal Disability Discrimination Act. Moreover, the Client shall check the content they provide in regard to legal admissibility, particularly in terms of competition, brand, administrative law and copyright. The Contractor shall not be liable to the Client in cases of minor negligence or after fulfilling a possible duty to warn for the legal admissibility of content provided by the Client.

3 Prices, taxes and fees

3.2. For library (standard) programmes, the list prices valid on the day of delivery shall apply. For all other services (organisational consultation, programming, initial training, adjustment support, telephone consultation, etc.), the work shall be invoiced according to the rates effective on the day of performance. Deviations to the time required as provided by contractual pricing, which is not attributable to the Contractor, shall be invoiced according to actual time required.

4 Delivery date

4.1. The Contractor shall strive to meet the agreed deadlines of fulfilment (completion) as closely as possible.

4.2. It shall only be possible to meet the intended deadlines of fulfilment provided the Client provides the Contractor with all necessary and complete work and files by the stated deadlines, particularly, the accepted performance description as stipulated in Clause 2.3., and provided the Client meets their obligation of cooperation to the necessary extent. 
The Contractor shall not be liable for delivery delays or cost increases caused by incorrect, incomplete or retrospectively changed statements or information and/or documents provided that lead to arrears of the Contractor. The Client shall bear any additional costs incurring therefrom.

4.3. The Contractor shall be entitled to make partial deliveries and/or partial invoices for orders consisting of several units and/or programmes.

5.3. Compliance with payment deadlines agreed upon shall form a crucial condition for the performance of deliveries and/or contractual fulfilment by the Contractor. Non-compliance with the agreed payments shall entitle the Contractor to stop ongoing work and to withdraw from the contract. The Client shall bear all expenses related to this as well as loss of profit of the Contractor.
In case of payment arrears, the standard base interest rate shall be charged. Should two instalments (in case of partial payments) not be paid, the Contractor shall be entitled to have immediate maturity come into effect and to render any notes payable due for payment.

The Contractor shall retain all other rights.
Involvement of the Client in the creation of software shall not entitle them to acquire any rights beyond use of the product as set forth in the Contract. Each infringement of the copyright of the Contractor shall result in claims for damages, in which case full amends are to be made.

6.2. The Client shall be permitted to make copies for archiving and data security purposes subject to the condition that the software contains no express ban of the licensor or a third party, and that all copyright and ownership notices shall be transferred to the copies without alteration.

6.3. Should the disclosure of the interfaces be necessary to produce the interoperability of the software covered by this Contract, the Client shall separately request this from the Contractor for a fee. Should the Contractor not meet this request and decompilation take place according to the Austrian Federal Law on Copyright, the results shall only be used to establish interoperability. Malpractice shall lead to damages. 

6.4. Should the Contractor provide the Client with software, whose licensee is a third party (e.g. standard software by Microsoft), the right of usage shall be provided by the license conditions of the licensee (manufacturer).

7 Right of withdrawal

7.1. The Client shall be entitled to withdraw from a respective order by letter sent by registered post, should the agreed delivery deadline not be met due to the sole fault or illegal actions of the Contractor provided that the agreed service is not performed to a considerable extent within an adequate grace period and the Client is not at fault.

7.2. Force majeure, work conflicts, natural disasters and transport bans, as well as other circumstances outside of the influence of the Contractor, shall release the Contractor from their obligation to delivery and/or shall allow them to determine a new delivery deadline.

7.3. It shall only be possible for the Client to cancel an order with written consent of the Contractor.

- The Client or an affiliated third party has not interfered with the software
- The software is used according to the designated conditions of use as stipulated in the documentation

8.2.2 With regard to guarantee, rectification shall, in any case, prevail over price reduction or redhibitory action. Should a notice of defects be justified, the deficiencies shall be rectified within an adequate period, in which the Client shall enable the Contractor for all measures necessary for examination and rectification.
Section 924 of the Austrian Civil Code ‘Assumption of Deficiency’ shall be excluded.

8.2.3. The Contractor shall, free of charge, implement corrections and additions, which become necessary due to organisational and technical defects of the programme, until transferral of the agreed services, insofar as these are attributable to the Contractor.

8.3. The Client shall bear the costs for assistance, incorrect diagnosis, correction of errors and emergency maintenance attributable to the Client as well as other corrections, changes and additions. This shall also apply to rectification of deficiencies, should the Client or a third party make programme changes, additions and other interferences.

8.4. Furthermore, the Contractor shall not be liable for errors, disruptions or damage caused by improper use, changes in components of the operating system, interfaces or parameters, the use of inadequate organisational means or data storage media (as far as these are required), abnormal operating conditions (particularly deviations of installation and storage conditions) or transport damage.

8.5. The Client shall lose any guarantee from the Contractor for programmes that are retrospectively changed by in-house software engineers or third parties.

8.6. Insofar as changing or adding to existing programmes forms the subject matter of an order, the guarantee shall apply to the change or addition. The guarantee for the original programme shall not be renewed by this.

8.7. Guarantee claims shall lapse after six (6) months from transferral.

9 Liability

9.1. The Contractor shall only be liable to the Client for damage the Contractor verifiably causes in cases of gross negligence. This shall also apply mutatis mutandis to damage caused by third parties brought in by the Contractor. In case of bodily injuries caused by the Contractor, the Contractor shall be liable without limitation.

9.2. Liability for indirect damage, e.g. loss of profit, costs related to interruptions, data losses or claims of third parties, shall be expressly excluded.

9.3. Claims for damages shall lapse according to legal provisions, however, at the latest after one year starting from the knowledge of the damage and the person responsible for this.

9.4. Should the Contractor fulfil work with the assistance of a third party and any guarantee and/or liability claims arise against this third party therefrom, the Contractor shall cede those claims to the Client. In such cases, the Client shall focus on this third party.

9.5. Should data backup be expressly agreed upon as a service, liability for the loss of data shall not be excluded, deviating from Clause 9.2, however, restoration of the data shall be limited to a maximum of 10% of the total order sum per case of damage, however, with an overall maximum of 15,000 €. Further claims for damages and guarantees of the Client than those stipulated in this Contract shall be excluded, regardless of legal basis. 

10 Loyalty

10.1. The contractual partners agree to mutual loyalty. Both shall refrain from headhunting and employing, even via third parties, employees of the respective other contractual partner, who work on the fulfilment of orders, for the term of contract and twelve months after the contract terminates. Any contractual partner infringing this clause shall be obligated to pay lump-sum indemnification to the amount of one annual salary of the employee.

11 Non-disclosure

11.1. The Contractor shall obligate their employees to fulfil the provisions stipulated in Section 6 of the Austrian Data Protection Act.

12 Miscellaneous

12.1. Should clauses of this Contract be or become invalid, this shall not affect the validity of remaining subject matter of the Contract. The contractual partners shall cooperate in order to find a regulation which comes as close as possible to the intention of the invalid clauses.

13 Final Provisions

13.1. Insofar as nothing else is agreed on, only the legal provisions regarding business-to-business transactions according to Austrian law shall apply, even if the order is implemented abroad. The local jurisdiction of the objectively competent court for the place of business of the Contractor shall be exclusively agreed upon for possible disputes. Pursuant to the Austrian Consumer Protection Law (KSchG), the Terms and Conditions above shall be valid insofar as the Austrian Consumer Protection Law provides no differing obligatory provisions for selling to consumers.

13.2 In the event that any disputes, which cannot be solved by mutual agreement, arise from this Contract, the parties to the contract agree to engage a listed mediator (Austrian Civil Rights Mediation Law (ZivMediatG) specialized in business mediation from the list of the Austrian Ministry of Justice in order to reconcile these out of court. Should no mutual agreement regarding the selection of the business mediator or with regard to content be possible, legal measures shall be initiated no sooner than one month after the negotiations fail. In the event that mediation could not be held or was discontinued, any litigation initiated shall be subject to Austrian law. As agreed, all necessary costs incurred due to previous mediation, particularly for legal advisors consulted, may be claimed in litigation or arbitration as ‘pre-trial costs’.

### Relevant legal basis
Below you will find an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
- Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DSGVO) - The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him/her for a specific purpose or purposes.
- Performance of a contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6(1)(1)(b) DSGVO) - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or for the performance of pre-contractual measures carried out at the data subject's request.
- Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) DSGVO) - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.
- Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO) - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.
- In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Austria. These include in particular the Federal Act on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data (Data Protection Act - DSG). In particular, the Data Protection Act contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to rectification or erasure, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Security measures
We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the law, taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the level of threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input of, disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account in the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.

Shortening of the IP address: If IP addresses are processed by us or by the service providers and technologies used and the processing of a complete IP address is not necessary, the IP address is shortened (also referred to as "IP masking"). In this process, the last two digits or the last part of the IP address after a full stop are removed or replaced by wildcards. The shortening of the IP address is intended to prevent or make it considerably more difficult to identify a person by their IP address.

TLS encryption (https): In order to protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use TLS encryption. You can recognise such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address line of your browser.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Transmission of personal data
In the course of our processing of personal data, the data may be transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.

Data transfer within the organisation: We may transfer personal data to other bodies within our organisation or grant them access to this data. Where this transfer is for administrative purposes, the transfer of data will be based on our legitimate business and commercial interests or will be made where it is necessary for the performance of our contract-related obligations or where we have obtained the consent of the data subjects or legal permission.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Deletion of data
The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consent permitted for processing is revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose for processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not required for the purpose). If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing is limited to these purposes. I.e. the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person. 

Our data protection notices may also contain further details on the retention and deletion of data which have priority for the respective processing operations.

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Business services
We process data of our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and prospective customers (collectively referred to as "contractual partners") in the context of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as related measures and in the context of communication with contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g. to answer enquiries.

We process this data in order to fulfil our contractual obligations. These include, in particular, the obligations to provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies in the event of warranty and other service disruptions. Furthermore, we process the data to safeguard our rights and for the purpose of the administrative tasks associated with these obligations as well as the company organisation. Furthermore, we process the data on the basis of our legitimate interests in proper and business management as well as security measures to protect our contractual partners and our business operations from misuse, endangerment of their data, secrets, information and rights (e.g. for the involvement of telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). Within the framework of applicable law, we only disclose the data of contractual partners to third parties to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfil legal obligations. Contractual partners will be informed about other forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, within the framework of this data protection declaration.

We inform the contractual partners which data is required for the aforementioned purposes before or in the course of data collection, e.g. in online forms, by means of special labelling (e.g. colours) or symbols (e.g. asterisks or similar), or in person.

We delete the data after the expiry of legal warranty and comparable obligations, i.e. generally after 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account, e.g. as long as it must be kept for legal archiving reasons. The statutory retention period for documents relevant under tax law as well as for commercial books, inventories, opening balances, annual financial statements, the work instructions required to understand these documents and other organisational documents and accounting vouchers is ten years and for received commercial and business letters and reproductions of sent commercial and business letters six years. The period shall commence at the end of the calendar year in which the last entry was made in the book, the inventory, the opening balance sheet, the annual financial statements or the management report was prepared, the commercial or business letter was received or sent or the accounting document was created, furthermore the recording was made or the other documents were created.

Insofar as we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms and conditions and data protection notices of the respective third-party providers or platforms shall apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.
- Types of data processed: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); contact data (e.g. email, telephone numbers); contract data (e.g. subject matter of contract, term, customer category).

Further notes on processing processes, procedures and services:
- Project and development services: We process the data of our customers and clients (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "customers") in order to enable them to select, acquire or commission the selected services or works as well as associated activities as well as their payment and provision or execution or performance. The required information is identified as such in the context of the order, purchase order or comparable contract conclusion and includes the information required for the provision of services and billing as well as contact information in order to be able to hold any consultations. Insofar as we obtain access to information of the end customers, employees or other persons, we process this in accordance with the legal and contractual requirements; legal basis: fulfilment of contract and pre-contractual enquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO).

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Providers and services used in the course of business activities
In the course of our business activities, we use additional services, platforms, interfaces or plug-ins from third-party providers ("services" for short) in compliance with the legal requirements. Their use is based on our interests in the proper, lawful and secure provision of our services.
- Types of data processed: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); payment data (e.g. bank details, invoices, payment history); contact data (e.g. email, telephone numbers); content data (e.g. entries in online forms); contract data (e.g. subject matter of contract, term, customer category).

<!-- omit in toc -->
### Provision of the online services and web hosting
We process users' data in order to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to transmit the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or terminal device.
- Types of data processed: Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times); meta, communication and procedural data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status); content data (e.g. entries in online forms).
- Data subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
- Purposes of processing: provision of our online offer and user-friendliness; information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.).); security measures.
- Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).

Further information on processing processes, procedures and services:
- Provision of online offer on rented storage space: For the provision of our online offer, we use storage space, computing capacity and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also called "web hoster"); legal basis: legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
- Collection of access data and log files: Access to our online offer is logged in the form of so-called "server log files". The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, the volume of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files may be used on the one hand for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the case of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and on the other hand to ensure the utilisation of the servers and their stability; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO); Deletion of data: Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymised. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until final clarification of the respective incident.
- Email dispatch and hosting: The web hosting services we use also include the dispatch, receipt and storage of emails. For these purposes, the addresses of the recipients and senders as well as further information regarding the email dispatch (e.g. the providers involved) and the contents of the respective emails are processed. The aforementioned data may also be processed for the purpose of recognising SPAM. Please note that emails on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a rule, emails are encrypted in transit, but (unless a so-called end-to-end encryption procedure is used) not on the servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore not assume any responsibility for the transmission path of the emails between the sender and the reception on our server; legal basis: legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
- Content delivery network: We use a "content delivery network" (CDN). A CDN is a service with the help of which the content of an online offer, in particular large media files such as graphics or programme scripts, can be delivered faster and more securely with the help of regionally distributed servers connected via the Internet; legal basis: legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).

### Communication via messenger
We use messengers for communication purposes and therefore ask you to observe the following information on the functioning of the messengers, on encryption, on the use of the metadata of the communication and on your objection options.

You can also contact us in alternative ways, e.g. via telephone or email. Please use the contact options provided to you or the contact options provided within our online offer.

In the case of end-to-end encryption of content (i.e., the content of your message and attachments), we point out that the communication content (i.e., the content of the message and attached images) is encrypted from end to end. This means that the content of the messages cannot be viewed, not even by the messenger providers themselves. You should always use a current version of the messenger with encryption enabled to ensure that the message content is encrypted. 

However, we also point out to our communication partners that although the messenger providers cannot view the content, they can find out that and when communication partners communicate with us and that technical information on the device used by the communication partners and, depending on the settings of their device, location information (so-called metadata) is processed.

Notes on legal basis: If we ask communication partners for permission before communicating with them via Messenger, the legal basis for our processing of their data is their consent. Otherwise, if we do not ask for consent and they contact us on their own initiative, for example, we use Messenger in relation to our contractual partners and in the context of contract initiation as a contractual measure and, in the case of other interested parties and communication partners, on the basis of our legitimate interests in fast and efficient communication and meeting the needs of our communication partners for communication via Messenger. Furthermore, we would like to point out that we do not transmit the contact data provided to us to the messengers for the first time without your consent.

Revocation, objection and deletion: You can revoke your consent at any time.

Types of data processed: contact data (e.g. email, telephone numbers); usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content); meta, communication and procedural data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers).

- Data subjects: Communication partners.
- Purposes of processing: contact requests and communication; direct marketing (e.g. by email or post).
- Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) DSGVO); Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) DSGVO).

### Newsletter and electronic notifications
We only send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter "newsletters") with the consent of the recipients or with legal permission. If the contents of a newsletter are specifically described in the context of a registration, they are decisive for the consent of the users. Apart from that, our newsletters contain information about our services and us.

In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide your email address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for the purpose of personal address in the newsletter, or further details, if these are necessary for the purposes of the newsletter.

Double opt-in procedure: The registration for our newsletter is always carried out in a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registration you will receive an email in which you are asked to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can register with other people's email addresses. The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the registration process in accordance with the legal requirements. This includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored with the dispatch service provider are also logged.

Deletion and restriction of processing: We may store unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove consent previously given. The processing of this data will be limited to the purpose of a possible defence against claims. An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided that the former existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the case of obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right to store the email address in a block list (so-called "block list") for this purpose alone.

The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course. If we commission a service provider to send emails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure sending system.

Contents: Information about us, our services, promotions and offers.
- Types of data processed: inventory data (e.g. names, addresses); contact data (e.g. email, telephone numbers); meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status); usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content, access times).
- Data subjects: Communication partners.
- Purposes of processing: direct marketing (e.g. by email or post).
- Legal basis: Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO).
- Option to object (opt-out): You can cancel receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent or object to further receipt. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter either at the end of each newsletter or you can use one of the contact options given above, preferably email, for this purpose.

### Plugins and embedded functions and content
We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These can be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").

The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the user, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browser. The IP address is thus required for the presentation of these contents or functions. We endeavour to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. The "pixel tags" can be used to analyse information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other information about the use of our online offering, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.

- Types of data processed: Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times); meta, communication and procedural data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, consent status).
- Data subjects: Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
- Purposes of processing: Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness.
- Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).

Further information on processing, procedures and services:

- Google Fonts (obtained from Google server): Obtaining fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of a technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to up-to-dateness and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible restrictions under licensing law. The provider of the fonts is informed of the user's IP address so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices used and the technical environment. This data may be processed on a server of the provider of the fonts in the USA - When visiting our online offer, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e. a software interface for retrieving fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Google Fonts Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and then the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by each user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent describing the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referral URL (i.e., the web page where the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and they are not analysed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent and referring URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wishes to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. With the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must match the font that is generated for the particular browser type. The user agent is logged primarily for debugging purposes and is used to generate aggregate usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregate usage statistics are published on Google Fonts' Analytics page. Finally, the referral URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregate report on top integrations based on the number of font requests. Google says it does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to profile end users or serve targeted ads; service provider: Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; Legal basis: Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO); Website: https://fonts.google.com/; Privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy; Further information: https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=de.
